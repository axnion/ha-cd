# HA-CD
Project implementation from my bachelor degree project in computer science at Linnaeus University. Used for testing the possibility of allowing rapid deployment techniques like continuous deployment or continuous delivery in a high availability archetecture through adapted zero-downtime deployment methods.

Works by using Ansible and an adapted blue-green deployment technique to fit the high availability clustering archetecture is used.
